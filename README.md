# final_project_template

Competition time! We will be using this starter template to practice HTML, CSS and Bootstrap in teams.  

Syntax, placement, best practices all count in this competition, so think about how you are indenting things and where you're placing things.  

I will post the directions on the screen; your team's job is to add the correct code into the correct place, and when you know that you're right, to come up to add it to my screen. If someone can improve how you've written or placed your code, they get the point.

You should be using the internet to help you if you're unsure of something!
